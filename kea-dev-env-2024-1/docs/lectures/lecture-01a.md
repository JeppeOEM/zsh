## About The Course

The overall theme for this course is **quality assurance**.

![Course Overview](../assets/course-overview.png){ width=70% }

This course is about all the things that goes into the project, except the primary code base.

This course will turn you into a much better developer.


## Forming Groups

!!! warning inline end "Very Important!"

    Please organize groups before leaving class today!

Because we are dealing with *collaboration tools* in this course, you are required to work in groups of **3 or 4 students**.

It will be a great advantage to you if you form groups so that you share a course where you will develop a large software project, e.g., **DevOps with Linux, Python & Django**.

You will find a `Groups-sheet` on Teams in the `Files` section.
List your **full names** on the group you are part of.
