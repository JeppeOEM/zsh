# Lecture 3b: Knowledge Management Systems

We will now take a brief look at *knowledge management systems*, also sometimes called *personal knowledge management systems*.


## What Is A Knowlegde Management System

A knowledge management system is a very simple thing: it is simply a system for keeping track of your knowledge.

    If you establish a personal knowledge management system and make it work for you, such a system can have tremendous value for you and your learning.

    If this is something you want to do, you should try to make it as universal as possible, and make it a life-long project.

More than that, it can also contain things like:

- Basic note-taking
- Todo list
- Documentation
- Reports and papers that you are working on
- Your blog

Basically, anything you can think of.

You are probably already doing these things in various ways, but what sets a knowlegde management system apart is that *it is all in one system*.


## Top-Down Or Bottom-Up

Basically, there are two strategies to build a knowledge management system: *top-down* or *bottom-up*.

A *top-down* system is a system that *impose a predefined structure*.
An example of such a structure could be a set of named folders (physically or on your computer).
In a top-down system, you will try to organize things by putting them in specially assigned places, or at least follow some structure.

A *bottom-up* system on the other hand, is a more *organic system*, where the contents slowly defines the structure.
You can do this by assigning *tags* to your notes, e.g., `#python` or `#kea`.
You can make up these tags along the way, and a single note can be assigned several tags.

    Building a personal knowledge management system is not all about the tools.
    The most important change you have to make is *to put everything* into your system.

You could use tags for a top-down system as well; in this case you would stick to a set of predefined tags rather than making them up along the way.

Wheter you prefer top-down or bottom-up very much depends on you as a person.
I have tried to build top-down systems for years and always failed, whereas when I started using the bottom-up approach it started working much better for me - but you might have a different experience.


## Build Your Own Or Use A Ready-Made System

!!! note inline end

    Remember: we are trying to build a system that can last the rest of our lives.
    We should be very careful deciding on the system we want to use.

You can find a long list of ready-made systems out there, just to name a few:

- Notion
- Logseq
- Zotero
- Obsidian
- Evernote
- OneNote
- VimWiki
- OrgMode

Some of these are free, some have free tiers, and some are commercial.

These products all have their pros and cons, but you may be able to find a system that suits your needs.

Alternatively, you could build your own.

    Building your own system does not have to be a major project.
    You can come a long way using your text editor, a few terminal scripts, and storing your data in a Git repository.
    You can slowly expand on the functionality over time.


## Things To Consider For Your Knowledge Management System

There are a number of things you might want to consider before making your choice:

- Am I in control of my data, e.g., can I easily move my data to another system
- Are my data secure
- Can I access my data from a mobile device
- Can I backup and keep change log on my data
- Can I access my data from my favorite text editor
- Can I extend the system to meet special needs
- How quickly can I access my data
- How effectively and efficiently can I search my data
