## Course Announcements

!!! warning inline end "Very important"

    Course announcements, e.g., if a lecture is canceled, will only be posted to :material-microsoft-teams: Teams.

All course announcements will be posted on :material-microsoft-teams: Teams.

I strongly suggest that you install :material-microsoft-teams: Teams on your smartphone, and enable notifications.


## Course Materials Home Page and Course Materials Repository

What you are looking at now is the *Course Materials Home Page*.
You will find all course materials here, including links to mandatory and optional reading materials.

You will find the :simple-gitlab:[Course Materials Repository](https://gitlab.com/keaorg/kea-dev-env-2024-1)
This is a Git repository, and you can clone and pull the repository to have an offline version of all the course materials, also after you finish the course.

You are welcome to make a merge request if you find errors in the course materials, or if you want to contribute with improvements.


## KEA Development Server

We will be using a Virtual Private Server (VPS) as a reference system throughout this course.
Please see [vps-reference-config](https://gitlab.com/henrikstroem/vps-reference-config) for installation instructions.
