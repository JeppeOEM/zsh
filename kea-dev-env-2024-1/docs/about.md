## Teaching Method

!!! note inline end

    Remember you are not alone!

    The course teacher is here to help you along the way, but it is your responsibility to come and ask when you need help.

Your study program is a Qualification Level 6 Advanced Education.

As a student on an advanced education, you are expected to:

- Be responsible for your own learning
- Be able to do research beyond what you are shown in class
- Make informed decisions
- Explain your reasoning

When you study for this course, your objective is not to *understand what is in the course materials*, but much broader *to understand the problems and possible solutions*.
You will most likely need to do further research on a weekly basis.
